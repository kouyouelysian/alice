# ALICE
Aubery's Logic Integrated Circuit Emulator

## What
ALICE emulates binary logic. It is designed to be faster than other online circuit simulators for the cost of stripping off all the complexity and dumbing down the "emulation" part (no transistors are actually emulated - sorry!).

## How
ALICE uses paper.js for GUI stuff. It has an object-oriented architecture, and the technical side of the project related to emulation is realised as extentions of paper.js classes, so that they support graphics by default. You can run ALICE by downloading this archive, unzipping it and opening index.html in a browser (don't use chrome though. no, ALICE will work out there, just don't use chrome.)

## Why
Because why the hell not and who's going to stop me

## Project state & licensing
This is a GNU-GPL licensed project meaning you can't make money off of it and should piss off if it explodes in your face. The project is in pre-alpha, meaning it's not fully working as intended just yet. Still, if you think you have some useful idea, feel free to share.
